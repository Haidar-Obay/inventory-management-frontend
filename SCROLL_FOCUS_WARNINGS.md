# Scroll Focus Warnings Solution

## Problem

Next.js 15.2.4 generates console warnings when elements with `position: fixed` or `position: sticky` have the `data-nextjs-scroll-focus-boundary` attribute. These warnings appear as:

```
Skipping auto-scroll behavior due to `position: sticky` or `position: fixed` on element: <div class="fixed inset-0 flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden bg-background" data-nextjs-scroll-focus-boundary="true">
```

This is expected behavior for modals, toasts, and other overlay components, but the warnings are noisy in development.

## Root Cause

The warnings occur because:
1. Next.js has built-in scroll focus management for accessibility
2. Elements with `position: fixed` or `position: sticky` are intentionally excluded from auto-scroll behavior
3. The `data-nextjs-scroll-focus-boundary` attribute is used to mark scroll boundaries
4. When these two conditions meet, Next.js logs a warning

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Warning Suppression Component
Created `components/ui/scroll-warning-suppressor.jsx` that:
- Runs only in development mode
- Overrides `console.warn` and `console.error` to filter out scroll focus warnings
- Preserves all other console messages
- Automatically cleans up when the component unmounts

### 2. Global Integration
Added the `ScrollWarningSuppressor` component to the root layout (`app/[locale]/layout.jsx`) to ensure it runs early in the application lifecycle.

### 3. CSS Improvements
Updated `styles/toast.css` to add `isolation: isolate` to the toast container, which helps with focus management.

### 4. Webpack Configuration
Enhanced `next.config.js` to include additional warning suppression in development mode.

## Files Modified

1. `app/[locale]/layout.jsx` - Added ScrollWarningSuppressor component
2. `components/ui/scroll-warning-suppressor.jsx` - Created warning suppression component
3. `components/ui/simple-toast.tsx` - Removed unnecessary data attribute
4. `styles/toast.css` - Added isolation property
5. `next.config.js` - Enhanced webpack configuration
6. `components/layout/main-layout.jsx` - Added warning suppression hook

## Usage

The solution is automatically applied when the application starts. No additional configuration is required.

## Benefits

- ✅ Eliminates noisy console warnings in development
- ✅ Preserves all other console messages for debugging
- ✅ Maintains accessibility features
- ✅ Only affects development mode
- ✅ Clean and maintainable solution

## Notes

- This solution only affects development mode warnings
- Production builds are unaffected
- All accessibility features remain intact
- The warnings were informational only and didn't indicate actual problems
